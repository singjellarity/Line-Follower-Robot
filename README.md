## Abstract
> A line follower robot or SumoBot is a robot that avoids an obstruction. By utilizing an Arduino Uno as a microcontroller to process the input of a sensor, it can control, with the help of a motor driver shield, a DC motor in order to build a line follower robot or a SumoBot.
## Parts
- Arduino Uno
- L293D Motor Driver
- 2 pcs. line follower sensor
- 2 pcs. DC Motor with gear
- Smart robot chassis and wheels </br>
